As I mentioned in an earlier post (link), I've been working hard to stay on track during my PhD and make consistent progress. As a means of doing so, about halfway through I decided to start 'project managing' myself and my phd. This meant I actually set myself up with small sprint cycles, incorporating many agile project features into my daily rituals. 

The first of which was a Kanban board ...

The second was fortnightly reporting periods to my supervisors ... 

A blog as my 'standup', although its not necessarily daily...

And fourth and finally, I am managing my PhD thesis as a software development project by tracking it in git. This is a trial basis to begin with as there may be unexpected side-effects that could be detrimental to my overall PhD. However, I think there are several potential benefits that made me want to try it out. These benefits include:
 - having appropriate version control : I get all the benefits of using git version control, such as being able to track file differences, revert changes, and 

 - backup
 - supervisors can view and contribute
 - 

And I've found that writing in plain text is actually far easier and more enjoyable than writing in Word. Don't get me wrong, I like the Office suite, but I've come to find that using Word to write my thesis drafts is counter-productive for me. I think the WYSIWYG approach and interface is distracting, in that the perfectionist aspect of my personality keeps getting caught up in the design and style of the page. Should I keep using the default Word theme? Is that heading big enough to capture the hierarchy of sections? Does the combination of my language choice and the text alignment and justification make this paragraph look funny? By migrating over to markdown, that is abstracted away from me and I can focus on writing content, safely knowing that the presentation and styling will be taken care of further down the track. It may sound funny, but doing it this way is definitely more conducive to me actually making progress on my writing.

Of course pursuing a change like this runs the risk of taking more time away from my PhD for setup and management. I have to be honest and say that I've already found myself being distracted by writing these blog posts, but hey, you have to spend money to make money. Here's to hoping it pays off in the long term.
