Recently I was involved in assessing the state of a web project that had been in various stages of development over several years. My main role was to assess the code base to see what was going on, however this was given to me in one big SVN dump file. 

When I began my undergraduate degree, SVN was still alive and well, so it is something that I have experience in using. However, the few skills I once had have been banished to the darkest corners of my brain to make way for the surge in popularity and ease-of-use of git. Without access to the svn server anyway, I was tasked with turning this single svn dump file and extracting its contents for viewing, with the possibility of migrating it to a modern git repository on a corporately supported GitLab instance.

I'm a self-confessed Microsoft fanboy, so performing this on Windows is not necessarily the easiest task. Fortunately, I have another love affair in Docker, so spooling up a lightweight Linux container to handle the load was my logical go-to. 

As a side note, while working on this problem I came across GitHub's 15 minute git tutorial, which I highly recommend for anyone new to git. I'm a big fan of interative web tutorials like this, and it was something that I wish was available to me when I was first starting.
