## PhD Abstract
The intersection of wearable technology and machine learning introduces a great opportunity to investigate implicit user reactions. Measuring variations in biometrics caused by mental arousal may be able to serve as implicit relevance cues in subjective topic domains, such as national security. In this talk, we introduce our evaluation of deep learning models capable of identifying topical relevance from user biometrics. Despite our results showing accuracies approaching 80%, there are several barriers to practical application, including user privacy and acceptance. We describe each of these, along with suggested pathways for future work.
