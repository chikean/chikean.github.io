## Data Science

Python is my preferred language for data science. I am familiar with numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, and jupyter notebooks. Anaconda is my preferred package and environment manager. For visualisation, I have experience using matplotlib, seaborn, and D3.

I also have experience using Matlab, R and SPSS.

I have used deep learning frameworks, NVIDIA's DIGITs. I predominantly use Keras, but have dabbled in Tensorflow, Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit and Theano directly.

I have experience using AJAX, interacting with backend databases, RESTful APIs, and using tools such as SASS. I frequently use front-end frameworks including Bootstrap. Jekyll.

I am comfortable with Linux CLI, have configured Apache and NGINX before, and have experience setting up HTTPS.
