I come from a technical background, but am good with people. I am a strong communicator with a passion for STEM outreach and learning. I specialise in applying a variety of research methods in order to investigate and develop data-driven solutions to complex problems. I am looking for opportunities that will challenge me and allow me to give back to the community.
