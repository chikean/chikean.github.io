        <p class="lead about">Currently I am a cyber security analyst, but have a background in web development, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. I am in the final stages of my PhD in computer science, in which I research the use of deep learning models to infer cognitive relevance assessments. I'm seeking opportunities that will challenge me and allow me to continue exploring my passions.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid" src="https://chrischowme.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/research.jpg" alt="">
        <p>I am currently a PhD Student within the Research School of Computer Science at the Australian National University.</p>
        <p>My research involves using physiological signals and deep learning models to predict topical relevance and interest in high-pressure environments.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the goals for my research will be to improve user performance and experience while under stress or uncertainty. I plan to do this by maximising the availability and potential of biometrics in an ethical and privacy-preserving way.</p>
