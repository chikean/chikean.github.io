I've always shrugged off blogging, thinking it was for people who had too much spare time. To me it seemed like such a waste of time and energy spent away from doing -- well, you know, <em>real work</em>.

Despite this, I've decided to give it a go. One part of me is inspired by comments on Andrej Karpathy's blog, while the other part thinks it would be beneficial for progress toward my PhD overall. There are plenty of many resources out in the wild that convinced me of the latter, not the least of which is that by writing a blog, I'm <em>actually writing</em>. As other current or former doctoral candidates may or may not attest to, maintaining full motivation and dedication is damn near impossible. I'm a big procrastinator, and with foreknown knowledge that I'll have about three years to get the work done, writing chapters of my thesis -- or even jotting down the simplest of notes or ideas -- sounds like a problem for future-self. As someone who can get very meticulous, even the thought of potentially wasting the first half of my candidature has encouraged me to pursue a variety of methods to help me get back on track. 

This blog aims to be one of those methods. I often have a lot going on in my head, with lots of great ideas for my research, however I struggle to put that down on paper. And that's despite being told many times that I'm a very capable writer; in fact the reason I often procastinate is because I am fairly certain I will a) remember the important information and b) be able to write a cohesive body of work without too much drama. Yet while this may still be true, blogging will help me actually visualise progress, and serve as a physical log to ensure I don't forget important concepts, and for easier facilitation of feedback.

I recognise that ultimately, it may not necessarily be a matter of copypasta of these blogs into my thesis. I'm sure half of what I write will probably have no bearing on my actual research in the long term, and anything that is even remotely related will undoubtedly require work to clean up the language. But again, the hope is that taking a more casual approach to writing will mean its easier to get started, and at this point any writing is good. Plus, there's also the hidden benefit of this blog being a medium for communicating my research, which at the very least is valuable practice for other settings.

And as for the blog name? There's an ongoing joke I have with people who ask me what I plan to do after I finish my doctorate. I tell them I'm going to abandon academia and the tech industry in order to pursue my dream of opening up my own Chinese takeaway shop -- <i>Doctor Chow's.</i>
